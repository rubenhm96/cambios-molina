== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to pay for using Google Map? =

Simple Business Directory uses <strong>Google Map</strong> which is <strong>completely free</strong> for 99% use cases. Once you add a billing account they will give you<strong> 200$ of free credit</strong> every month - recurring which is usually more than sufficient for most websites. Please check this page for more details: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/

= My Google Map is not working =
1. Make sure to have both API and Application restriction set to None or restrict them to your domain name properly from Credentials->API Keys->Your API->Application restrictions

2. Ensure that ALL the API libraries are enabled including Javascript, Geocoding and Places APIs etc.

3. Also, from the middle of 2018, Google requires you to add a Billing account. Although, for 99% cases you won't actually have to pay anything as the free usage limit is quite high for almost any use cases.

Check the plugin's Help area for more details.

= Address Auto Complete, Latitude Longitude Generation not working =
Address autocomplete and Auto Latitude Longitude Generation will work if you set up the google map API properly. Please answer to the question above for Google Map is not working.

= I have setup List Categories and Lists and neither is showing on home page. Did I install correctly? =
You have to put the short code on the WordPress oage or post page where you want to show the List/s. There is a Shortcode generator in your page or post visual editor. Use that to create shortcode and insert to your page, where you want to display the lists, easily.

= Is SBD mobile friendly? Does it function well on cells and tablets? =
Yes, all templates are mobile device friendly and Responsive.

= Why can I not add more than 37(or any other) number of links in one list? =
The issue you are having with saving the Lists is because of a limitation set in your server. Your server probably has a low limit for how many form fields it will process at a time. So, after you have added a certain number of links, the server refuses to save new link items. The serverâ€™s configuration that dictates this is max_input_vars. Set it to a high limit like max_input_vars = 10000. You can do it with local php.ini file or htaccess if your server supports it, Otherwise, please contact your hosting company support if needed.


= Can You Add More Features? =
Please check pro version of the plugin with tons of extra features

= How can I upgrade from free version to Pro version? =
1. Download the latest pro version of the plugin from website after purchasing
